description:

This is as simple a SED-ML file as you can have and still produce output:  it points to a model, simulates it, and reports the output.  The model itself (both the SBML version and the CellML version) have a single variable, 'a', with a value of '3' that doesn't change.

Antimony version of the model:
  a=3

PhraSED-ML version of the SED-ML:
  mod1 = model "00001-sbml.xml"
  sim1 = simulate uniform(0,10,100)
  task1 = run sim1 on mod1
  report time vs a
